# Copy user from LDAP to GitLab

It should be noted that this script is actually a fork from [LDAP users to Gitlab](https://github.com/mhaddadi/ldap-users-to-gitlab/) except it dosn't syncronize groups/membership and is more compatible with Active Directory.

 ### Prerequisites
 * use of ldapsearch from ldap-utils package
